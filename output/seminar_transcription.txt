in this allison content and i'll be along tonight and that's flat tax is sponsored by sanitation scientific friday makes his advance to laugh the acquisition of comprehensive he hundred tons of highly free press and accurate and science convocation using marylin day they didn't attend an acquisition will do yeah a mass spectrometry in this letter past wheeling fees powerful new math is the human pritchett analysis and single cell protein makes that this unprecedented speed and that's the defense says it has fallen by mccabe says that he had hostile to concentrate in the study by little princess is a vast scale based in bulk and at the tree single cell level with a crazed peptides and pray scene identification enhanced quantification accuracy indeed the coverage even a lesson glades resent his that any insights fast and more lively than as a peaceful you accessed lies actually this offense by selecting english british at the bottom right hand corner of the p. g. a. plan witness in the sea is it that is yes and the olsen precise set up the ines de it had been taken the lead in the lungs a question on secession with ethiopians you asked the question any kind you wish for outlet pass the tv say they set up westin where it says i have a question he had an anti sends an old oppressed thousand again is that since the day and now and it's elastic okay thanks for the introduction sold the year the yacht lot off my talk would be that i will go into first discussing sickle cell protein on max and how we use a very sensitive mustard from a tree to look at both protein abundance and turn over in this eclipse permanence of all we've developed it should deport throw all the plot this to oppose are like experimental to go single soul uproar y'all make analysis on the continuum that by talking about the new law to trap out strong schlossberg short term and all your sinful very high throughput of high sensitivity were close it off to do up to two hundred and seventy hurts acquisition and we explore the noto when court mold for sickle cell protein all mixed up and i'll wind up with some partial foss real mixer experimental we all should use the diversity in all in combination with dinner or which are best roles rome and that is a loss to drool barry foster that acquisitions systems would there you go three hundred samples today we even five clubs samples today and still there it's very hard for you all over it she adjusts to remodel saw was on the challenges that be faced with an unstable sold for your expect compact soap box sample transcript comics so if we take it you're so we'd all that the prom estimates though they stomp real makes at the porno mckenna says that we have frothy six billion coaching copies in a single he does so wet the corresponding him army that transcripts ah or iran six on the socks and so that means we have ecstasy on this out for difference in both the bottoms and in the nemec rains that between the transcript told by the pro or you'll of course i'm an oscar trauma tree we don't really have any peace ya amputation of a double showbiz means we need a very high sit sit sit sit in our sample preparation and also when all the message analysis the solution fausto to do or say also porno mags so was witty and all the trap astral ma spectrometer one this was said introduced because the send off for the first on trooper full narrow window prelate admitted the solstice distinctions between interdependent acquisition and they that independent acquisition allowing us to do yeah a whiplash nation when told that we were to pick you you're sent into the wardrobes this spa spectrometer that basically is a combination of fraud often the explores for eighties and the new law where losses at the astral a boss become a shot at the back end up at all stupid because we're so when paul but in the astral ma spectrometer to topeka online trek miles of rafi thirty beaters it can provide him as a mess as scan grades off more than two hundred hertz acquisition them at that even get to talk some narrow window road isolation with and it has extremely high sensitivity which single i'm depiction so we don't need to do when he never itching off the scans this in combination with a pipe bomb in a crane says and them is to get lost two to identify and quantify proteins across a very good at a roar frames often important that material and even from single cells we could identify more than four off osment a proteins that are that way any particular optimization she's so this is frosty to tom's foster sequencing speed dent and tom stall sensitivity to the pitch of the previous explores floyd eat a generation of course is it also bore ya makes your soul faced with challenges in december preparation and we really want to be my students actions which surfaces you'll choke protein extortion losses of this is special to specific one group or put heart phobic surfaces so it's important to to two samples as concentrated as possible at work in this war was possible boardrooms job and you need to miniaturized the sample preparation of course we want to minimize the offer evaporation to maintain sensitivity and also returned to be dutiful all analysis that we ought to to work with the seven one which is the commercial this ocean of fossett also porno mags de knowledge troop move very precise never be the dispensing your shitty a critic drop it that generation to court she had this relaunched have to separate edition ours and analyze said individual single cells the buyer table so boredom excel we use this in combination with it for your chip you want to six will be content to what the protein extraction and digestion directed using d. n. a moscow makes and then it to face this would direct transfer back to you know on da due to this then allow us to analyze the obstacles so preparation said on deity bullshit one with the whisper soon as it's true back to my sensitivity and performed the bostic analysis on the portrait astral due shrinking narrow window yeah eight an acquisition strategy using this combination met with afford examples for dame whisper message on the air giver subsystem we can identify to you the more than five thousand pro change from individuals' single cells and then this is even using the relatively narrow window acquisition of said well rewarded you for tom some isolation windows and sixty seconds the ejection charge that seemed to be the best a compromise and entrance of them since two tickets this is a study also still on maintaining a very high up outside corroborates we identify more than four thousand peptides from single seat in the cells when we do this a acquisition and they're based on this sample preparation the support she would justify proteins operates as we enter the i. able to spend more than five orders of magnitude and dynamic range in a single u. s. o. and from this we connected to quantify bolden hundred fifty protein kind aces of the first time we're lost to start to look at the suckling state of individual cells from this life upside clover its which also stopped and looked at for pollsters say some modifications without before in a specific in richmond city just by analyzing them all foreign spies searching them with fox applesauce four nation as a parable modification and from the nemesis like this we can see that we can identify a and your own frosty to order to auschwitz insights in each individual single soul this is all the history of the sites that often most about and once in the cell so we can see that they may indeed at a yacht to a protein directed that physicians are chief indicating that they like to talk it's off the prominent in the high bases said the second dependent on aces and the irk mapped kind uses a good bet throughput of just four samples today we of course limited to the number of single cells that there we can analyze and therefore we work for quite excited when the nukes to whisper folks a method so became available but we could go even foster are maintaining the as sensitivity and that they will throw rates soul going from affordable spud they mess up but we have roughly twenty two minutes of active elsie gradient to look at toppling the year this speech to a two and a examples but they will get down to just to twelve by detective radiant or even a hundred judges samples put a method would just as six minutes at active at all seek radiant and analyzing all our sickle cell of your preparations with this was aborted we could see that we did have a slight loss in the number off a protein step we put them identify an end quantified but we still get to read a typical coverage with their coastal for hopped off the proteins even from the hunt and twenty samples to date as the public he's very foss grady and so there we of course also both it's extremely narrow cut its best become a movie which was sick call road salt with a formidable could they left it to pick the half full with off maximum of little more than three seconds repeated west with the examples today we're down to score off second profit and with the hot didn't try to separate the game is to pick out should just one point five second of this of course means to be picked fuel pointed across the teacher and we saw for a bit in deep accuracy of deportation to weed out all have to basically match the acquisition method with the yellow foster gradient such that the two hundred twenty samples today methodology we had to change to annoy injection time off just three music and serb for a simex moment it isn't time allowing us to get as can siphon off just point seven five seconds so putting all this together uh-huh active yet modest to do very sensitive fanaticism we could even a depict embryonic stem cell transcription factor is from a year ikea seed sales and we can see holiday changes in abundance one because it would defer jason screamed and a different shape them into a embryo or two bodies so also detecting our fault and gibbs and socks tool in the sales so this is off used the very paul full the technology but we're wondering if we could also dead on top of just doing protein abundance measurements also stopped and looked at the protein turn all work in kuriyama 'cause at them a popular way to add to this sister you're stable isotope raping white amino acids of so called show sigh like aunt deb doing a horse psyche experimental that has traditionally been taught at the altar level is the loss to look at both the protein synthesis and they're approaching degradation and of course the combination of this would indicate the protein turn all the implementation of this in the second soap or sell makes a calms with this all problems solo because we want to do yeah a setback occasions we of course have took it all diane so than from all the new identity peptides that they have to be excluded for the quantification as bait basically have expected the same boss from pole to haiti and by the types we saw when beaded should it says that this on t. scores for a date that it was really important to have a high sensitive it did because with that all broke broke his speaker identify we may take our hearts and distort rituals and what could news for this is that the we have for your sensitivity will be introduced or sidek because we split the allstate all into also every uh that shot from the protein what allah p. s. poll for heavy and i'd like to talk of course we have the limitation debris could only do want something tom foss this emotion was ready to do with your truck astral bostic trauma truck with the narrow window the i. a. dedication and be used as a combination of the dog where tip tip or troll lab with the senate mon that and that we have opted for doing destabilized to open eight rings that the horse i like experimental basically pulsing cells assaults that they were a for a time pointed that was roughly equal to the whopping time of the cells and abide we could ensure that him skimming cooperation what your rafi want to one ratio between the heavy invited additions and they're in this situation is also where we are best and doing a trip to bear quantification show from these experiments we condemn would look up they have yet like upside see that proteins with this'll turn or what have been going cooperation of the baby isotopes compared to that light isotopes west proteins with the medium term will work with your put the rafi want to one ratio and roll changed with the foster an old ones sure walk with that where barry about him ted haviland maple the peptides india on spectrometer will this city of course wanted to see if all single point to them measurements in net in single cells the book ornate that room with all measurement for beacon to worship old time points to perform a very accurate to bear on its asian and then i'm katie we saw that will be used all their human therefore skin flap west cells that are the precursor sells for the iq seized at the extreme cold war have a very poor correlation between the single soul single top what measurements and the yep them or to watch antoine from the pulpit measurements but as you may be able to appreciate from the bottom but said the variation is obviously a very high between the two old and this is exactly why we want to look to do with the measurements at the single cell levels us that we can't have identified the ticket jolts else states are based on the turtle first sold to do well nostril experimental whipped at the polls direct we performed an ikea see tiffin jason scheme will we have induced that these embryo to report is from our deceased and then we went through a long distance jason scheme but we to gawk at six different a typo and strain to defend shaking course as else that had been course label for twenty followers but the sonic him he jumped you performed or single source or drink at preparation fall elsie m. s. analysis and performed all the analysis on t. all the trap of straw boss patrolled on showbiz exit a bad august true that quantify a cell type specific marcus up across more than one thousand individual as single cells that we could see that this spontaneous defense asian off the iq sees fit to sell sides offer a level sides cardiac in it's just a hit at six in that shed its natural and we go back to the non-stop soak up at the both the protein about guns and eternal were off these individual a cell types and we can see the fort sample approaching turn over off anti oxidant enzymes in the attic limits is very different from the corresponding term or off the same proteins in a memo sides old endicott a cup dead in the starch cells wes if we look at the protein about him said the summing up the heavy and like debt ratio should we can see that the defense in protein a bomb into session in march or that the difference in the journal on top of this we noticed that the then turn or her analysis x vietnam was to identify members off approaching complexes as relieved flexible the call members of their glorious own us up units at their strong a coronation in terms of their own approach the internal or although we noticed that the cold stone says they succeed them is if you're good to him that a bomb or both that distribution in terms of their aside like incorporation grapes estimates that indeed it's cells from the road in this show a pots of the year to fidget in cost at the very height cooperation and better off the air heavy amigo as its west says at the beta stages of the year of the dissertation calls we saw a very low or cooperation off the heavy amigo as it's an them this was again a strong acorn a bit as sold the different than the cornerstones of his own bedroom it's two way it's true being and ted it's free and teddy to fall edge of the displayed the except to say i'm a bit by marble distribution and and very strong coronation that between them in toronto for his own a heavy sigh like incorporation told we were wondering if this were back to did you wake up equipped differentiate between them cells that are actively dividing and dead and cells that are no longer a bed in active in the cell cycle so true confirmed as we performed at fermented dia issue and polskin thoughtful gazelles again will be issued a look at mom called when that dividing cells we could see that in terms of fail he spoke for him or up that they had a very tough asta cooperation of the heavy amino acids if we look at cells that were hiding complimented we head into the contact inhibition and therefore so cycle the rest we could see that we get this uh i'm awful distribution gobi have both mixed foster and soul turned over a list olds away as if we performed as arab starvation experiment in order to synchronize the cells by arresting them into t. zero g. want phase of the cell cycled we can see the week may indeed have said this first roll on roll turned over off the list old so this a little stupid eve that it's looking at the turn or off his old system to begin at the important way to differentiate between dividing and on dividing cells in the bitter genius so population on top of this we could then have got to look at the head or will they information for example off the fence so cycle markers such as so the mc him three a protein that is more to be that important to him yes faces off the cell cycle and also information about the assault by amateur bit what it is so we could see that bed looking at them again as a function it offers to accept what he stole rates fall them to the site in cooperation but differentiating between the dividing and on dividing cells we can see as expected the dividing cells have bought by our bond and so fed him see him three protein called depth with a non dividing cells and they're saying we could see chaucer prospect of dividing cells actually in gentle seemed to be doctrines are scope have to dividing cells suggesting that it on dividing cells are still with the barbecue yeah sit and continue to grow in size sold off this information could basically peta ricky captured him to combine protein turn or dynamic said analysis you ship or sidek in the single cells one other thing that we noticed was that that if get city had bought hire called rich off proteins in general will be looked at la shock s. else compelled to work to swarm of cells and then this prompted office to a to look even closer at the new all the trap astros all bah spectrum of a wet the new light sensitive away put old would allow us to get a viacom rich off the walk on didn't go proteins all the proceeds from swore on single cells and this is also due to the fact that we can use this new high insensitivity are performing predicaments and independent at trapped in the front of your instrument so with the law would include mold we've issued a test that can make a comparison directed between the all the trouble astral tool but emptied the first generation or the trip astral bostic trauma to bet you're saying a heady that bode digestion and to analyzing it to autumn fifty people prem which is roughly equivalent to offer single he vessels and we could see what the new middle when pope mobile county astral this old ma spectrometer up that we could increase the number off precursors all fall i'm stand up ma strains are also if you performed the analysis and i'm all natural ma strange will be put on all four on going jackson talk to repeat maximize the year of the sensitivity and this was then also the record reflect that the n. double both protein said all should approaching korean deeds that they could detect from it at ease single saw them equivalents these experiments when it should be performed without same spot we then decided to also met at the same store used to for the maximized the sensitivity they're off the analysis and then initially we performed a the sweep off the tiffin compensation board just to see if we could identify at which the compensation board says we were maximized the number off precursor simple change that their pickup to take them with this new there's no one could open and we could see that it seems to maximize said wrong to see the value of software rafi minus forty eight to one of forty six balls we then applied to this tool actual single soul of preparations is the what we used to summon want so short alter the cells and the and performed is sickle cell that analysis on the year of all bitch i pressed for shawl boss spectrometer and we can see that when we perform these experiments that it makes it quite a significant at the friends if we apply the same spot on fame soul with ames we can see the week it's like a normal brought up todd said detected but at the protein level that especially when we use the search strategy and a spectrum on weekend uses to try to sell their territory all men in that by repeal a mold became a city that the average option rafi six thousand six hundred proteins old with and without thinks the cells of course for the city gossip sells so we were wondering if we were interested in the starting event or sell types that we would have to then decrease the the input a mobster quite significantly so we perform bate that motion series of federal tuna s. bobbing from just a hundred legal rambo robin cook material all the way down to just off the pickle ramp where on column and then comparing ia astro shore road with the new low we put bolted and also applying the optimal of fame sparrow conditions that from this experimental it can see that especially yet been very low when ports around the corner hof tool five a ramp of material is really will be gained the most and then on parole for epcot center proteins that we can identify it into your offer of the thirty percent extra bet that we can identify and to this is said obviously says something that we would be very interesting now to apply chose or sell talks for sample peripheral brought more chaos also ppm seized at me to coexist off term he sells sent there and the cells and did so generally off the four times more on the net that yourselves and that means that they all week on chamber off the three to five rounds off a proteins which is expected within you know when poor old british on she social or not that bad a lot of ppm see cells we could see the deaf week up by almost sensitive fed up stratus seat with the year of fame sandy year by rick that yeah they would you carry on the strategy that we can identify quantify rafi fifteen hundred troops who thought the proteins in ease up into the tool ppm see cells work that we have to pay out and this coverage is sex abuse of fish and farce true identify him over or roughly fifty percent off all the adaptive in your tipoff ways so we can't use in the differentiate between the two cells and anti sell some also stop to look at some interesting apology and indeed first also types the new law spectrometer is so obviously much foster ted bundy ulrich smoke dope chapa astro sold off the first experiment the beeper for bush that he should do like him that ejection time castration serious in steps of just to wear syrup on board milliseconds because we get this additional rafi won the second term ejection time for free india and a trap the front end of the instrument we're at the side is to stop at just wanted a second the eject and todd sand and reform that this agitation series ought to look far better off with a second certain objections on both the old truck astros rule but at the old truck restful images we can see that prompted one point five meters second said off injection tom at that the instrument that superstructure up the troops who wanted sixty hertz for acquisition of wes appeal the trap that astral ma spectrometer we can't see that it seemed to be around two or two point five is accusing jackson time at that the acquisition raid crops down to about two hundred hertz serb acquisition of them look at what is actually the number off that drives the beacon detect fama to orbit nanogram take two one three digest their own kong we can see that this sex in the fits barry well with the optional but ejection time we have maximum power its asian off the nemesis with the all the tribe astro shown that seemed to hit the wrong one point five them it is sick and said jackson johnson terms of bumper offer you need to our stubby to detect we can see that your truck on stroll ma spectrometer to peak at round two point five for me to second sarah in charge of the number off them at todd's that there began to take that and do you want one thought music and sped up on the ultra best social with the additional one millisecond ted injection time to be kept for free india and trap at citicorp step toward a hop music and subjects in time on the waltrip astral asta commercial told that in all of this together and using a bear trap the new into this system on the vanquished new york the oprah can operate under three on the samples today method we can see that we can basically increase the number off or you'd peptides the big tent attack from just about eighty five thousand on the older trap astral to go to haunt us osment on the all the trap astro jewelry bostic trauma to the abyss and also need to an increase in the number of proteins that began to take from eight thousand troops rafi ethos number four hundred baht and then we can be maintained very high them a protein intensity correlation between dia epic engage in indicating that we preserve for quantitative accuracy even though we scammed but foss thought the good way to test the air quantitative performance of the instrument is to use a year so called free speech is is because we mix east rory on twitter what forty own sent the koran lepore almost in at the five great show she always keeping a human cory own ship constant all want to want one and then change the terms makes offered ceased at the koran or your chair according and we'll get our lives to wear these samples on dia all the truck astral and the old tabasco soon become see that we could increase the number of proteins that direct attack from the goal thirteen thousand to more than forty of softball teams quantified on the altar chavez partial mosque trauma some but even more important we can see that beat her serve very high her quantitative fair actors seed and look it bury them like this and that the agents them and they succeed matching the expected to the ratio shirt off the that speeches mixes as above a new very nice feature on the old traps rule as crucial ma spectrometer up and that is the new emma swan enhanced by mimic rents range scan feature or ya and said this is particularly interesting to do so in combination with it at that depended acquisition then well the mule and hence the memory greenspan's basically an almost took see even wall where candidates fall triggering a dirty gait analysis the year it has been emigrants again it is said this kind of a boxcar has a like strategy it will be you're sent him as one white sim gwynn doorstep be condemned where combined and analyze as a single a full scan them and it never would this weekend been performed the sms acquisition in the year astral a bostic from church all the enhanced by the mid range scan sticks place in the orbiter that we can see what we call chaos a between injections with and without the enhanced the mimic raids against the bid to meet increased it dynamic range is that all false signals a suspicion the fall board all about and where that size pieces india it will spend so we see ya tool for a better or twenty four to an increase in in dynamic range and all together we can see that the enhanced the mimicry instead be better to detect a mini mall sitting there in default anticompetitive standard at the swamp scabs and this is then are making a better reflect that indeed number off a peptides and proteins that began identified in the da experiments show we can see that with the enhance the nemec reigns as cam feature of this woodstock that we can all identify more than a abe foxman to him the curses and the fanciful experiments with the increasing the cooperate compelled to look at all standard to the d. a. missteps and the main reason for this is that we simply trick 'em all miss him as scans across the board elsie gradient so we can see indeed yes then says lots of the ubiquity and so well then in the beginning and at the end of the gradient that would be enhanced the mimic rates can see up a increasing that we are bochco so through the maximum hundred fifty hertz acquisition rates that compare to the standard that the d. a strategy also de orbit trap s. troll and all the year all the trap astros all our spectrometer soul will wondering if we could use this new very foster said methods a city to pay at accomplish it to a comprehensive or you'll and we've previously shown that this is actually possible to do but you need to perform a massive offline then fracture nation that typically using high ph reverse faces a chromatography it and then analyzed that many factions which short online radiance and in all the original manuscript of describing to you all the chopper astral ma spectrometer up we show that would bet thirty full flexion s. strategy and analyze for the hunted made examples to date the policy that we could have identified and quantify it echo through that wall more than twelve thousand proteins which is the topeka is injured the old approach is expressed in a in a single soul so we want ray knowledge that mule and foss de ma spectrometer and if we could keep the old total number of fractions all go with the foster bowater i'm ill seated at acquisition strategy and still be able to dictate that the twelfth often proteins a in a hate to live three cell and this analysis basically told us that with the new ma spectrometer we could get comparable called rich using the freedom of the samples today in mid september thirty four fraction strategy s. soul is the pianist of free yourself combined analysis time and now identified o'clock to five cents to the or protein serb expressed in us all on top of this because of this very high peptide coverage we can then also stopped who propulsion fisher once occasions without performing any specific in richmond his soul for example searching would close formation as a bum gobble modification be waiting to take to quantify more than two fosse fosse for this insights then indeed fracture may deter samples on top of that we can also stopped a hopeful splicing and then you know as it said no substitutions and get extremely high coverage of the snow the bands from arab and is fresh made the samples with previous to perform with that i'm a very extensive the analysis office to launch representing the different organs said in the body and then that was all on on the old truck astral ma spectrometer and with their thirty samples they methodology in order to get us up to cover its as possible okay both off the pro oriole and off the force for pro real but we would all wondering if we could use that much fahnestock that all the truck astros on them are spectrometer a adding combination but foster greatly and so to speak both a hobbit make examples the day of the three of the samples to date and then re analyzing all pieces so i'm forty olds and we could see that would even the three on this sample spud a method to get the extreme be hike over its saturating the round on average son i'm thousand five hundred proteins in each cell on that we could to identify and quantified whoopee to see that we'd wait to do this woodbury hybrid to do it this ain't even comparing for your own shriek or that haunted maybe samples that they met with both the berber accorded a free on tiptoe samples today and to even doing like an old when they put their principal component and then this is your hook up the cells as expected to s. separated the based on the origin of the self lots and that the automated established a date for a olds is it the mets the debris on the samples that they pour your boobs and that they will bear it also indeed the p. c. a lot more exciting mean we then turned to even foster radiance soul the new diversity all that provides said that optimize instead chromatography system at an all star to perform five on the samples that they bess sherman she where we basically it bodes a little bit more than one minute of all feds active eric radiant and we can see that we did that extreme geek now roll them up todd the oceans would have full with prospects him almost just one point three second so we thought that this strategy that in combination with the older trap astral chihuahua spectrometer at this could be interesting to see what kind of a protein called rich we would be able to target from them in front of their cell lines so when they should be tested to bend them they too want to rely say to them with the five of the samples today with that and from this comparing to the the ultra battle ma spectrometer we can see that with the schulman we recall from fifty two with osmond you need have trod stroke of the sixty seven thousand to their unique that tarts also taking us about seven thousand they're unique in protein corey genes to become call for indecent experiments and again even with the five of the samples could they method we preserve very hybrid katyusha bigoted show all the proteins but with quantified him brett pickett rods which were generally more than seven thousand we can see the week at the extreme dick would wear coronation circuitry and approaching the bottom says in gentle with her coronation coefficient chauffeur point nine nine soul but this five other samples that a method to we basically just seven seventy two a second depth active greatly and that we can see that when i'm bob they're active grady and we entity ebb off a better one false move to a german had tried to become identified her second if we look at the city from the beginning of the active part of the big radiant that we can see within the first fifty seconds we're busy people to identify fifty thousand dead you need a types and then translate to at the rectory in show that in seven seconds of the gravy and we are apt to hoffman proteins identified in forty seconds of the gravy and we are at full thought proteins and just look at all the hoffmann it to their of the great and we already covering ball than six thousand for cruelty and serbs and the samples and this is not only for the uh hey can then i say it's that we basically to almost as similar numbers when we yemen lai said he'd allies say that it with this five one two samples the date of the dollar which he had at the thought the scanning had narrow window peoria curses and evident on to you all trapped astros who was spectrum of a we can see that we are a getting quiet cooperate if we wear go all but even at fifty nanogram we are able to get rid of music with a protein and the uh that type of coverage serbs in the samples and with the all the trap astral shalom in all cases all performing the orbiter petrol in terms of mom bro for proteins and the trust a beacon to take and also in terms of the hall maybe we can quantify well with c. b. spiegel a twenty percent of all ten percent so i hope that in compulsion enough about the degree to the dimmer switch you that the new law which are best also ma spectrometer up discussing competition with the diversity in oil seed anna is really up call for strategy to acquire barry foster comprehensive pro realms with very high peptide cover its be able to identify quantify more than seven thousand gold chains that the five on the samples they mess up the new instrument as a very high since that c. forcing corso prodi all mixed using to know you're going put mold in competition with saints that we able to identify and quantify more than six thousand six other proceeds in a single he does so you're saying that to the farmstead elsie methods of sixty to seventy two a shambles but they the single soap for yom expects to get off to quantify where embryonic stem cell subscription fact so center and they are then is specific markers what we do look at their its themselves said but takes four different the that the sensation of strategies we have now throughput offer eighty two hundred and twenty souls today it would be to this in combination with the air show which floor it's and we combine the reports i like we can also perform for your watch forty internal by mannix measurements and finally out just like to acknowledge served all the people and that's what did the work also a cost them their press members and also all buckles preparation papa said third for the fish are a scientific and teddy worship and their present our sciences and of course also the funding agencies that makes or authors possible and fire like to thank you for your attention and out the happy to take questions thank you thank you barry let's say yes ethel his presentation and it's now time to life question and answer session if he i toss a question please i am now where it says title questions hey an empress and it's best not to the dead a week the crash massage your eight hundred and say why will take off without wong and all the advantages of narayanan day cia thankful that question them all visited the advantages that then we cannot do it yeah eight that analysis and get spectroscopy koernke off aid to dependent their acquisition strategy so the tool of farah basically become bearers of a thief and nineteen unless you got another question us come in as well walk proud says the modified to optimize narrow win date the abbe methods yes well then secondly and a number of parameters that we are not playing around with phobia ought to marcinko narrow window delaying their strategies obispo thick window stars and also the maximum by law been taking time and there they pee wee also been paying a route would be the boss rage that that we want to call her so we try to find the best compromise between bob strange that they're injection time in order to maximize its to t. and still keeping the specificity barack area i'm not doing narrow window isolation so typically go for it to come for charge and cheap and advice classes was unique in summation disgrace to make provide compacted to name a slut conscripted mix all best of the vessel arthritic inflammation and compound uproar your ex compared to work to try to talk mixed a protein som of course the active players and the sell them what to close up to the year two to zero type arab we can see that in general this or a modest better coordination between the abode and so for protein center of the corresponding him on a transcripts and this of course that you're to the fact that the protein turn over it's very different from the corresponding him on a bare turtle or sold proteins can't be all rift in the cell all boldly have a very short list that on a soda i think it's much more portman to trip up approaching esteban this level of them at the record him on a transcript of all a problem that when we start to look at the porsche official modifications we can of course or sole custody the activity state welfare of proceeds and steve accept with many proteins also enzymes if they are in day out active or inactive for an all this is so of course transcript of mexico be to god to please the kids and see if a nice crest this what kind of the cases the famed astral xena spencer case yeah but is this across the bold and maybe from bath sensitivity or did he see any bias in the additional identification so ya mean of course what did we get the cia type reputation we we have to strike a compromise and it was raids that we're clobbering and barrow didn't get all true that with the i. a. even there the woods and the narrow d. r. a. them stretch the weed we try to better make sure that we all would be analyzing peptides that op the triptych peptides and in particular that are bred to feed shortcut in them in there that makes up so we need to be killed nicole walk through the robber thoughts maastricht shots units because they have fuel fragmentation travel somewhat easier than to identify from america where inspectors and see me go some questions coming in and disclose about sample preparation one amazing pulling considerations that go to paris single cells as a puzzle so far to have it or two in the presentation of beth think the bolt important to a pot offers single celled preparation is troop miniaturized the back or airport throw and this is basically to avoid that protein absorption or suspect we we have would be better have sample so that in that in contact with different surfaces better at the same time of course when you look at miniaturize their the board you won't you can also get high approaching and approaches concentrations and therefore an interruption of iced tea which appeared work much more efficiently than keep was the minimum number of points across the tsetse found to get that close the case u. n. inspection will be added a analysis so yeah i said i mean good traditionally you off course would like to get lionel five to oh nine points across the peter get re equip aquatic agent but with this very foster methods this is simply not possible that what we're seeing this that ted kennedy as you can get three points across the peak you're connected to get their corporate quantitative especially because sweet typically identify many peptides her proteins and and billfold roaring op that the peptides to the protein little bit today to get very very accurate quotation they would all be three to four points or across the peaks of this and see eighth asset in any testing with us some homemade to seize any comment on any species for example i yell we have to tip the different that tissue type said as well them with a temp work with the plasma and they're in particular the years to yourself a material and that also surged through to work pretty well that as long as you are a half the sample preparation on the control or let him particularly older briana sick olvera polls that but that is important in ninety without question southland out any shadow inside sunday yeah a aches and alice onassis off lance ito asked if it ends up there in yeah so i mean in principle we agnostic to but should the software tools said that the the way you're saying but on the door greta as to the number of them have right now then we may be your spectrum rocket that diana burlap wrapped and they are studied to be very very comparable in turn joe for coverage insensitivity india india nemesis all we're quite happy with the rules and he buys question is can see these tells of them are but a surprise that saying an ice asked that be in a stampede for example how low identifying approximately seven thousand proteins from yo five hundred stds pate de soto in detention fed the for the analysis of mindy get the downstream a processing to go off the files though we haven't met online tool that that automatically takes the role pauses that being generated and their search them with says good bye and direct the arrow but they are the spectrum ivory and with pre lada samples but they basically you can't keep up the with the analysis but with the five of the samples forbade it lex luther behind soul arab we we cannot perform the year of them pietro analysis as foster a on the software side as we can all be a bostic persisted shot now so that is to the falling apart on deck and keith cook questions that they will try next monday prisoner is he can now do next on his he demonstrated that each identified a number of false and peptides in and read some holes in it they seek he said state senator whilst it is the ramifications yeah absolutely i'm a bet that said basically what what they want to do especially a phobia of werewolf i'm fracture may deter samples well begun to take more than two thousand phosphorus and socks and the event where hundreds of affirm that amino acid to substitutions center of gaza formed stood nearby think we can to stop to remind the spread spectrum fall many other types of reporters racial modifications at which samples were doing by the open shirt share strategies job episode in the planning great and he ice crest is did he try running t. and t. in any case that in some astral xena and stays as it would be made in testing harry no fault somehow instrument of fools and now unfortunately not we we haven't had tried out all that although said that try that solo iconography their common to vote on that right now that may affect also in the plants that was when we want to do that then i scratched and betsy feel great presentation and i was there when it is possible to attack this price let at christie's impasse in some polls don't have so i made that there's no reason why this would not translate the rectitude of the approaching to that of course depends on who are you treating that the plasma if you wanna loop fault that if it's like the plasma or if you plan to do when the perfection agent orange in richmond their strategies butter but in general that we can see what the press was samples and that is if samples to become of authenticity spacing seek comparable to a bottle the plasma that berube weekend to serve a very high identification rates even though we shortened the gradient by effect for two or two to three weekends and we've got a great place these next aggressively c. n. n.'s if i thought that was how do you get that last assembles projects he was seen instances that he's at his death bed down so we i mean it in our lap we are to body very interested in it shouldn't be the cole's show were we typically from plasma and this is a phantom of the body fluids boom that perform but you know are susceptible to a gym in order to enrich the there you need is all that we perform but some of these new word but they keep based their enrichment of strategies and a big ben also analyzed that the ticket their plasma fraction of which but it's a different at this very very important that that the samples have been treated the intersect in the same way from the proper has been drawn up on told that the samples of being a centrifuge stalker was you can get buried mixed results with his antique cigar few wallace ethic lessons and i saw this was the reason to he's an egg sack full sep analysis is there any comparison with the house seats i mean we entity in to change it to us both the bush separate at the vanquished then you'll fall autistic he their measurements says we stand about it and you're separated because it said it's a great advantage to have the very people to the weekend the open them the soul to the all the samples and that they basically functions as a disposable recall on a directly into your worship elsie system so that means that we have buried earnest carrier work from the injection to injection and that means we can brom thousands of injections of the same columns and we don't have to do extend to show what extent of washes serb between each objection by and keep them no question about paris eisai c advice in a vase ethics cam can this method easy to identify point five ice ice in human blood samples and one that we haven't tried but also by i don't see why not then as long as you a bed and i made use of search those dreaded see them off the words were you ring true but he had databases that their country and approaching sequences of the root of the parasites that you interested and i think this should work for a while and because you get what's the coverage than with traditional the bus atop so you should have a gentle for of identifying in that the parasite proceeds will see that i speak for some relatively complex on both sides to sell ice t. recommended chilton method and low income yes lizzie was a higher rating than this essay in a teapot tides that crazy then i'm i mean did that if you want to run a lot tougher off sample survive this up is beyond any instrument but especially on t. on the f. roles in general it's good to aruba walk the input of malts because speak at the teeming cycles you should use gale swept the total amount offered peptide important that the instruments of fairer have seen so and then with the short radiance not what we have sensitivity that is comparable to what saw would much longer gradient serb the previous week began at a door and this material at that still over essentially the same herb for real for about four p. m. the court of our

mentioned we're we've just as many different their software so that in the lap top rory all my analysis says i think both spectrum out and the anti and where works there pretty well also fall for the
